                            <h4>Why executive-level talent? </h4>
                            <p>Strategy is all about acquiring core competencies needed to achieve its end-state image or a point of arrival by a certain timeline.  To secure a company's competitiveness, core competences shall need to be possessed, not borrowed. These core competencies can be further decomposed into processes, systems and people whereby people or talent come out on top in terms of significance.<br/>
                                We choose to focus on executive-level talents from Korea's top 30 Conglomerates and <i>Fortune</i> 1000 global companies for they can make a timely impact and contribution leveraging 20+ years of their best-in-class functional expertise and leadership capabilities.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Why is it important to connect them to SMEs and foreign-funded businesses?</h4>
                            <p>Global leading companies deploy so-called best practices for each department/function/process as an enabler to achieve their given goals.  At the crux of such deployment of best practices are executive-level C-suite talents.  Local SMEs and mid-sized companies have traditionally been insular homes of single-breed loyal executives hand-picked and hired by the founders.  During the transition stage where the 2nd or 3rd-generation owner CEOs would have to step up and come forward, it is then that is needed to think about re-grouping their executive team by bringing in new breed of senior executives from outside.  Foreign companies with presence in Korea may also have a need for talent from Korean Conglomerates.  The experience at the headquarters is different from that of overseas branches.  This is because the head office is where strategies and policies are developed whereas overseas branches would receive guidance from the head office and implement them.  Plus, organizational complexity shall be different between the head office and branch offices and thus, organizational management experience coupled with leadership maturity from the head office can be sought after by foreign companies in Korea. </p>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Why Veteran CXO? </h4>
                            <p>Veteran CXO was established by the desire to connect best-in-class executives and functional experts with domestic SMEs and foreign-funded companies that may not have such expertise internally yet.  Veteran CXO is the first company in Korea to provide career management services for executive-level global talents and talent search services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and foreign companies that need their competencies. <br/>
                                Veteran CXO differentiates itself from other online recruitment portals by: </p>
                            <ul class="dotted-list">
                            <li>We do not accept headhunting companies as members.  This is because it does not fit our mission.  We serve to provide a
                                platform for small and medium-sized/foreign-invested companies to search directly for their executive talents without paying
                                a success fee to transactional headhunting firms acting as an intermediary.</li> 
                            <li>We do not boast of our member count.  This is because we are not an online recruitment portal whereby the majority of the
                                members are at or below the manager level.  We only accept members with 100% executive experience on a selective,
                                invite-only basis.  This is because we know very well that the number of final candidates for any final recruitment interview
                                would eventually come down to 2-3 people and our candidate(s) will be among them.</li>
